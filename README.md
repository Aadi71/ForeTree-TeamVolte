# ForeTree-TeamVolte
Semester-1 Project 
ForéTree project is developed by Team Volte.
We are not above nature, we are a piece of Nature. We, humans, are depleting our energy sources and blessings that our Mother Nature has given us so reckless and incautious of the fact that we are just a puppet of Nature and Definitely Nature has shown us many times that how human FORLORN in front of Nature.
To solve this massacre our TEAM VOLTE brings you FORETREE.
We have made GUI, ForeTree BOT, EnergyMaze game, and Calculator.
To represent this concept of our project we have used animation to create a story that depicts the importance of our Project ForéTree.
Go watch out project.
